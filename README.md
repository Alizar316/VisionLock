# VisionLock
VisionLock is a computer vision project built with OpenCV that automatically detects and tracks multiple targets within a video frame in real-time. The system not only identifies each object but also locks onto them, providing an accurate count of all detected targets. Its robust tracking ensures that targets remain identified even when moving across the scene. This makes the project useful for applications such as surveillance, crowd analysis, automated monitoring, and interactive systems.
